First update .env file to server folder
Update these variables down below to .env file and set them as you want.

## SMTP ( EMAIL Service )

To setup email functionality which we are using for forgot and resetting password.
I have used Mailtrap.io , you can use any Email Delivery platform.

```
EMAIL_USERNAME=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
EMAIL_PORT=25
```


## Database ðŸ“¥

If you don't have mongoDB installed on your local machine then create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and add the link to your .env file.
Also update ```server.js``` file code

in server.js , update DATABASE_LOCAL to DATABASE
```
const  DB  = process.env.DATABASE_LOCAL.replace(
'<PASSWORD>',
process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD
);
```
in config.env
```
DATABASE = ??? if you don't have mongodb installed.
```

## Server ðŸ”§

Go server folder and install the requirements and start the server. 

```bash
npm install
npm start (for production)
npm run start:dev ( for development)
```

### Done ðŸ¥³

App is ready to go. Check the localhost with the port ( default=3000 ) that you set for PORT in .env file. 
http://localhost:3000
